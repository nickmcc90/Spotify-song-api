# Music API, api key store - Made with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express.js, Stripe, Firestore

This store allows you to purhcase an API key that gives you songs based on the vibe you want, either 
on a prepaid plan or a subscription plan with metered usage. You can check the status of your keys, 
navigate smoothly through the website, and visit the DOCS page to understand how the API works.

## Purchasing an API key
If you don't want to spend too much, you can buy a subscription key and not pay anything at all until you use it.
When you use it, it will charge your card 5 cents. Then, if you want to be done with the key, you can paste your key
in the status bar and a cancel subscription button will pop up!
