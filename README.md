# Music API, api key store - Made with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express.js, Stripe, Firestore

This store allows you to purhcase an API key that gives you songs based on the vibe you want, either 
on a prepaid plan or a subscription plan with metered usage. You can check the status of your keys, 
navigate smoothly through the website, and visit the DOCS page to understand how the API works.

## Things I learned from this project

Skills learned: 
How to...
* Develop a project vision to be broken up into multiple logical parts, with commits for each function.

## Purchasing an API key
For now, Stripe is in test mode for all API key purchases. This means that you can purchase an API key for free as long
as you type in 4242 4242 4242 4242 as the credit card information and any random strings for the rest of the information.

Have fun discovering the new songs!
